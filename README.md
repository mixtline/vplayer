#Test task

##Video player

You need to develop simple html5 video player using next recommendations. This is great way to see how you’re dealing with OOP JavaScript concepts, CSS skills and possibility to develop scalable apps with future in mind.

Don’t use any build tools and precompilers for JS.

###Controls list
- Play/pause/replay (change icon according to current status). Replay will appear when video is finished. The large play/replay button should be presented in the center when video is paused or finished. User should be able to resume playing by clicking on it. 
- Mute
- Volume bar (with click/drag volume control)
- Timeline to display current progress (with click/drag video seeking)
- Video duration display
- Current/Remaining time display (user can switch between different views by clicking)
- Toggle fullscreen

###Code requirements
- Player must be written in object oriented way to be extendable in the future (keep this in mind).
- You can use Font Awesome icons for UI elements.
- You can use jQuery to play with DOM. All other third party libs/frameworks/plugins are not allowed.
- Player must be supported by all modern browsers (Chrome, Safari (Mac), Mozilla Firefox, IE11)
- There could be 1-4 player instances on the same page

###Styles requirements
- Player must have custom styles and be independent from other site styles. Nothing special. 
- Feel free to use some of preprocessors (Less, Sass, Stylus, etc)
